# CS2000: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Welcome to the CS2000 course repository for "Design and Analysis of Algorithms." This repository contains comprehensive notes, well-commented source codes, and various resources to support your learning journey throughout the course.

## Course Overview

This course delves into the intricacies of algorithm design and analysis, providing you with a solid foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical implementations. By the end of the course, you will have gained a deep understanding of various algorithmic techniques and their applications in solving complex computational problems.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Fundamentals of Algorithm Efficiency Analysis
In this section, you'll learn the basics of measuring algorithm efficiency, including time complexity, space complexity, and Big O notation. Understanding how to analyze algorithms' performance is crucial for designing efficient solutions.

### 2. Asymptotic Notations and Mathematical Analysis of Algorithms
Explore asymptotic notations like Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega. Dive into the mathematical analysis of algorithms, allowing you to express their efficiency in precise terms and compare different algorithms objectively.

### 3. Algorithm Design Techniques

#### 3.1 Divide and Conquer
Learn the divide and conquer strategy, where complex problems are broken down into smaller subproblems, solved recursively, and then combined to obtain the final solution.

#### 3.2 Decrease & Conquer
Discover the decrease and conquer technique, where you iteratively reduce a problem's size until it becomes trivial to solve.

#### 3.3 Transform & Conquer
Explore the transform and conquer approach, which involves transforming a problem into a different form that is easier to solve, and then solving it using appropriate techniques.

#### 3.4 Greedy Programming
Study greedy programming, where you make locally optimal choices at each step to eventually reach a globally optimal solution.

#### 3.5 Dynamic Programming
Dive into dynamic programming, a powerful technique for solving problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.

### 4. Limitations of Algorithmic Power
Understand the limitations of what algorithms can achieve. Explore problems that are inherently difficult or impossible to solve using traditional algorithms.

### 5. Quantum Computing & its Role in Solving Algorithmic Problems - An Overview
Get a glimpse into the cutting-edge world of quantum computing and how it has the potential to revolutionize the way we solve complex computational problems.
